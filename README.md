This Project contains a vulnerability assessment and remediation plan for a small e-commerce business. The project, conducted as part of a Google Cybersecurity course, evaluates the risks associated with a publicly accessible database server that stores sensitive customer and business data. Key activities include identifying potential threat sources, assessing the likelihood and severity of threat events, and proposing actionable security recommendations. The remediation strategy focuses on enhancing access controls, implementing strong encryption protocols, and reducing the attack surface to mitigate risks. This analysis highlights the critical role of securing information systems to maintain operational integrity and protect business assets.
